        <p> Imam Malik bn Anas was one of the foremost four imams that are followed in their position on interpreting Islamic laws<a href = "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shariah.asp"> [shari’ah]</a>  Imam Malik faced a severe trial in his life . he held the view that a divorce , if its pronouncement was uttered under duress , did not take place . he  taught this openly in his study cycle . this had been the view of the prophet‘s companion Ibn Abbas [RA]. Some of Malik‘s rivals went to the caliph al Mansur [or his officials ] and said;Malik means by this that the oath of allegiance the people give to you is invalid if they do so grudgingly . ‘’ as a result , Malik was summoned and flogged at least forty lashes . Malik was beaten until his arm suffered permanent injury , so that afterward he would always cradle one hand in the other . this was all because malik insisted on narrating Ibn Abbas‘s statement .’’ there is no divorce for one who is under duress .the account of Malik‘s persecution varies in its details from one historian to another.</p>
        <br>This was all because malik insisted on narrating Ibn Abbas ‘s statement .’’ there is no divorce for one who is under duress .the account of Malik‘s persecution varies in its details from one historian to another. The most detailed account is that of Abu al-Arab al-Tamimi who provides more than one chain of transmitters back to malik‘s student relating what happened; There was a great agitation in Madinah during the reign of Abu-ja’far. In response, Abu-jafar dispatched his cousin Jafar bn Sulayman al Abbasi to quell the uprising and have <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina> Madinah</a>’s citizens renew their oath of agelliance.
